    <p><pre>         <b>Mental Health Monitoring using CNN Algorithm.</b>
         Mental health disorders are a growing concern worldwide, yet many cases remain undiagnosed due to the lack of accessible and objective assessment tools. Traditional methods of mental health 
         evaluation often rely on subjective self-reporting or clinical observations, which can be inconsistent and time-consuming. This project presents an innovative solution by developing an 
         automated mental health monitoring system that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for real-time facial emotion recognition. Looking ahead, the system has potential for significant 
         enhancements and broader applications. Additionally, deploying the model on edge devices could enable real-time monitoring in resource-constrained environments. This project not only advances 
         the field of affective computing but also contributes to the growing need for accessible mental health technologies, paving the way for more proactive and personalized mental healthcare solutions.</pre></p>
